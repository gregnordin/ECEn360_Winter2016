**Instructor**: [Greg Nordin](http://www.ee.byu.edu/faculty/nordin/)

**Content**: IPython notebooks and other files (python apps, powerpoint, etc.) to supplement course material

**How to Install Python 3.5 On Your Computer**:

1. You will need Continuum.io's Anaconda python package, which makes installation of python particularly convenient and trouble-free.
2. Go to [Downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and download the Python 3.5 Graphical Installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the Installer's instructions.

**Download All Files In This Repository**:

2. Unzip the file

**Alternative: Download All Files With Git**:

1. From the command line on your computer, navigate to where you want to download the repository.
2. Execute: git clone https://github.com/gregnordin/ECEn360_Winter2016.git
3. This will create the directory "ECEn360_Winter2016" and populate it with all of the files in this repository.
4. Note: a good introduction to git is the free [CodeAcademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

**View IPython Notebooks Without Installing Any Software**:

Click [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gregnordin/ECEn360_W15/tree/master/) for the transmission line ipython notebooks. The notebook files end in ".ipynb". Note that clicking on a notebook file renders a **static** html page in your browser (made with nbviewer.ipython.org). You therefore can't execute any of the commands, but you will be able to see the notebook contents without any problem.

**How to Use IPython Notebooks**:

4. After installing Anaconda, use the Anaconda Launcher application to launch IPython Notebook, which will open a new tab or window in your default browser
5. In this new tab or window, navigate to your local folder containing the repository (ECEn360_Winter2016)
6. Open the desired IPython Notebook file
7. To execute an input cell in a notebook, place the cursor anywhere in the cell and type return while holding down the shift key
